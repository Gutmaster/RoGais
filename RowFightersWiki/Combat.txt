Created Tuesday 05 December 2017

Combat is turn based and [[Combat:Rows|row]] based. Units act one at a time. Each unit has a set amount of AP to work with. They can use this to move forwards or backwards into a new row, choose combat actions, or take a [[Combat:Stances|stance]] and end their turn. Combat Party most likely consists of 4 units on the player's team, and any number of enemies.
